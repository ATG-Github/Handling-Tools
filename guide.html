                    <p>Also known as, the point around the vehicle will pivot when tumbling mid-air.</p>
                    <p>This is initially defined as the model's world center, which you can check in OpenIV's model
                        viewer.
                        Handling.meta's vecCentreOfMassOffset offsets it to put it wherever we need it to actually be. Y
                        means ahead/behind, Z means up/down. You don't need to edit X (left/right) most of the time.</p>
                    <p>CoM is directly tied to fRollCentreHeight(Front/Rear), and both together define how bodyroll on
                        the
                        vehicle behaves, because the CoM pivots around and over them.</p>

                        One of the most important aspects of Handling.</p>
                    <p>Interestingly, Grip is measured in G-Forces, which translate to how fast the wheels can
                        accelerate-decelerate the car before starting to skid. This ties in directly with braking and
                        torque, which also are measured in G-Forces. If there's not enough grip to accomodate torque or
                        braking, the wheels are overwhelmed and will lose traction.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>fTractionCurveMax: Defines the original maximum ammount of Gs the vehicle is able to work
                            with.
                        </li>
                        <li>fTractionCurveMin: Defines the original minimum ammount of Gs the vehicle has when skidding
                            or
                            losing traction.</li>
                        <li>fTractionCurveLateral: Seems to define the tire slip angle. This helps define the optimal
                            slide
                            angle at which the car has the maximum grip.</li>
                        <li>fTractionLossMult: Defines how griploss scales on troublesome surfaces like grass, dirt or
                            snow.
                            Check materials.meta to know how much grip each surface detracts.</li>

                        <span class="h5">Bodyroll & Suspension Pressure effects on Grip</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>Surprisingly, V simulates grip gains (and loses) from suspension pressure. This means that on
                        whichever tires the car is leaning to, get a significant ammount of traction, while tires on the
                        other side lose traction.
                    </p>
                    <p>This is best seen on FWD vehicles, which have a real hard time getting traction on launch. If you
                        reduce bodyroll or move the center of gravity forward, the issue is greatly reduced.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Only roads make the most of the vehicles' grip, and other surfaces like grass, dirt,plastic,
                        concrete
                        and snow reduce the overall grip. fTractionLossMult scales how important the effect is.</p>

                        <small class="text-muted">fInitialDragCoeff, fDownforceModifier</small>
                    </p>
                    <hr>

                    <span class="h5">Air Drag</span>

                    <p>Air Drag is presented as a force that acts against the car's velocity, and tries to slow it down.
                    </p>
                    <p>In V, air drag scales with the square of speed, but fInitialDragCoeff modifies the scaling so air
                        drag actually scales the way you need it to.</p>
                    <p>Air Drag can be measured in Gs, which presents how fast you are decelerated at certain speed.</p>

                    <p>Due to V's vehicle engines outputting "torque" in Gs, both values can be compared easily, which
                        gives
                        us more information about the vehicles' performance.
                        For example, as both the Gs from torque and the Gs from air drag even out, the vehicle stops
                        accelerating - at that speed, the vehicle can't push through the air anymore. You got your real
                        top
                        speed.</p>

                    <span class="h5">Downforce</span>

                    <p>This is one of the most arcade systems in V. Downforce translates directly to grip gain on the
                        wheel,
                        and can abide to wildly different rulesets depending on your needs.</p>
                    <p>
                        The base math goes as follows:<br>

                    <ul>

                        <span class="h5">Base</span>
                        <small class="text-muted">fDownforceModifier set to 1 or less</small>

                        <li>0.035Gs, double (0.07Gs) if a Spoiler is installed.</li><br>
                        <span class="h5">Dynamic</span>
                        <small class="text-muted"> fDownforceModifier between 1.01 and 99.99</small>

                        <li>0Gs as the car is stopped, which ramps up to 0.035Gs as the car reaches its top speed.
                            Double
                            that if a Spoiler is installed.</li>
                        <li>The value is multiplied by fDownforceModifier, so a modifier of x10 would net you 0.35Gs
                            gain
                            per wheel, double that with a Spoiler.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span class="h5">Active Spoilers</span>

                    <p>Vehicles with active Spoilers ignore fDownforceModifier entirely.<br>There are two types of active spoilers in V:</p>
                                        
                    <p>Raising type (Like the T20):
                    <ul>
                        <li>No gain when the spoiler is down. As the spoiler raises, you get 0.035Gs. When braking,
                            the
                            spoiler pitches, and you get 0.07Gs.</li>
                            </ul>
                        Dynamic type (Like the X8 Proto):
                        <ul>
                        <li>0.035Gs when the spoiler is down. Over certain speed (60mph or so)it raises up to
                            0.042Gs.
                        </li>
                        <li>When cornering or braking, it gets to 0.07Gs.</li>

                        </p>
                    </ul>

                    <hr>
                    <p>The base power is just a base value on top of which everything else works. Then, gearing
                        modulates that power simply multiplying it up and down (the ratio), which results in the torque
                        (also measured in Gs) sent to the wheels.</p>
                    <p>While the first and last gear's ratios are always the same (3.33 and 0.9) the gears in between
                        have different ratios depending on how many gears the engine has at its disposal. The more gears
                        it has, the smoother the torque drops from gear to gear - very few gears will result in an
                        incredibly high torque drop on the next gear.</p>
                    <p>Keep in mind the ratios always have to go from 3.33 to 0.9, so the more steps you give them, the
                        smaller the jump between each gear.</p>
                    <p>Those gears stretch over the engine's top speed, naturally.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, while the car is busy switching gears, you have no power. How quick this happens is
                        defined by fClutchChangeRateScaleX.</p>

                        Often times, you only need to take care so it sits between the front and rear axles, so the
                        suspension doesn't lean back or ahead. Then adjust rollcentres until you get the desired base
                        bodyroll.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        I personally prefer to get it somewhat right and move it up as much as it makes sense for the
                        car. This is a bit harder, but pays off when the car ends up tumbling around (This is GTA) and
                        actually rolls downhill properly. Helps with the personality too.
                    </p>
                    <span class="h5">Stability</span>
                    <p>As hard to work with as it is, vecInertiaMultiplier is very important to make cars heavier or
                        nimbler, and is responsible for the overall stability of the car. Do try to get it right.</p>
                    <span class="h5">Grip</span>


                    <p>Grip numbers are a good base, but vehicle stability is absolutely key to be able to make the
                        vehicle be able to use that grip. Just adjusting bodyroll and rebound you can completely change
                        how much grip the car can actually use. </p>
                        <p>
                            Dynamic Downforce (>1.0) is great to make cars specialize on high speed cornering.
                        </p>
                        <p>Traction loss is more complex than numbers. You can make cars horrible offroading just by making the suspension stiff or have little travel. fTractionLossMult is not that important.</p>
